Here are various websites, papers, blog posts, and textbooks that I often
recommend to people, or find really useful in general.

## Programming/Computer Science

#### [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
Interactive website with great visualizations that teaches how to use `git`
*and*, most importantly, what the commands are actually doing. I recommend this
website to anyone who is wanting to get a "proper" understanding of how to use
`git`, or even for general beginners who might not necessarily know the basic
commands yet. If you've mastered the basic commands of `git` (`pull`, `add`,
`commit`, `push`), this is a great next step.

#### [Git Cheatsheet](http://www.ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html)
Interactive cheatsheet that visualizes how to move changes from the 5 different
levels of `git`, along with descriptions of what each command does.

#### [Rookie HPC](https://rookiehpc.github.io/index.html)
Documentation and tools for the MPI and OpenMP standards. It's hard to find
clear, well organized documentation for these backbones of the HPC world, and
this one is fantastic.

#### [Differentiable Programming from Scratch](https://thenumb.at/Autodiff/)
An introduction to automatic differentiation. It was an honorable mention in
3Blue1Brown's [Summer of Math Exposition
2](https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some2).

## Mathematics

#### [Keith Conrad's Mathematical Expositions](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/)
Fantastic small papers going over the fundamentals of a math subject. They're
well written, and don't bite off more than necessary. I particularly enjoy his
exposition on [metric
spaces](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/analysis/metricspaces.pdf).

#### [An Introduction to the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf)
Does what it says on the tin. Gives an intuitive overview of the [Conjugate
Gradient method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method),
while also giving intuition to other important concepts along the way, such as
condition number, eigenvalues/vectors, and preconditioning.

#### [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/)
The best textbook on *understanding* linear algebra on a fundamental level. The
proofs throughout the book focus on intuition (by having the determinant
"banished to the end of the book", in Axler's words). My personal favorite part
is the fact that it makes firm connections between continuous linear algebra
and "matrix" algebra.

For student's at Universities, I'd
check with the library to see if you can get a free pdf copy of the book if
you're interested. The textbook itself isn't absurdly expensive either ($50-60).
**Update:** Axler is apparently working on a 4th edition of the book, which he
plans to be [open access](https://linear.axler.net/Eigenvalues.pdf).
Axler also has [video lectures](https://linear.axler.net/LADRvideos.html) on
YouTube to go along with the book too.
